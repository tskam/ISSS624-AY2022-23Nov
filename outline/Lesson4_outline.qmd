-   [**gwrr**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gwrr/index.html): its geographically weighted regression (GWR) models and has tools to diagnose and remediate collinearity in the GWR models. Also fits geographically weighted ridge regression (GWRR) and geographically weighted lasso (GWL) models.
