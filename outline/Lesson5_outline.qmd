## Overview

In this lesson, you will learn the basic concepts and methods of machine learning techniques specially designed for geographical data. Upon completion of this lesson, you will able to:

-   explain the similarities and differences between non-spatial Random Forest (RF) algorithm versus geographical weighted RF algorithm.
-   calibrate predictive models by using appropriate geographically weighted RF algorithm for geographical data.

## Content

-   Basic concepts and principles of recursive partitioning methods
    -   Decision Tree and Regression Tree
    -   Random Forest and Bootstrap Forest
-   Introducing Geographically Weighted Random Forest
    -   Weighting functions (kernel)
    -   Weighting schemes
    -   Bandwidth
    -   Interpreting and Visualising
